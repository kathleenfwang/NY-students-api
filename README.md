# NY-students-api  

## Description: 
 
I wanted to make an api tool that would gather data about high school achievements, particularly centered around SAT scores, for the high schools in NY. I mostly wanted to focus on the high-achieving school demographics, such as gender, race, and income distributions. I wanted to make data visualizations of this data and see if there are any trends or patterns comparing the demographics of high achieving vs lower achieving high schools based on SAT scores. I may later bring in other variables such as graduation or literacy rate. 

## Wireframes: 
 

## API: 
  - I will be using the 2012 SAT scores for NY high schools api: https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/f9bf-2cp4
  - Also be using the 2013-18 NY High School directory api: https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/s52a-8aq6
## MVP: Write out what your goals are for MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of your app.
  - Be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
      - I also will try to incorporate google charts in the HTMl 
  - Use Axios to consume data from an external source, and render that data into the DOM.
  - Use Grid 
  - Implement responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop) using 2 media queries (tablet and mobile).
  - Host on Surge. 
Post-MVP: Write out what your goals are for post-MVP, including nice-to-have features that you would like to implement once your MVP is complete.
  - Might include other features
